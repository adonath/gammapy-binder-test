4 Crabs runs with simulated event lists based on H.E.S.S. IRFs
==============================================================

* These files will become the new reference dataset for Gammapy tests and examples.
* Do not use these files for now!
* The event lists are simulated.
* At the moment they are incorrectly simulated ... work in progress, see:
  * https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/issues/1663
  * https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pull/437
* IRF testing is ongoing ... there's some known issues.
